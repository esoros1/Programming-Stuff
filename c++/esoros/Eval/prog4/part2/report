-Unit Testing is no good, you need to work on more testing scenarios for first, 
 You need to test if first method got a correct sexpr, the processing 
 inside is correct, the result is correct too  
 for example: for (first (quote (a b c)))
 Have eval received a aList? s.identity == aList?
 Is the first Atom "first"?  Second atom "quote"?  Third atom a? ...
 the result, was is an sexpr?
 Is the result a?
 Sure, still, you can write more tests.  Make these pass: (first (rest (quote (a b c d)))),
 (first (rest (rest (quote (a b c d)))) )   (-2)
