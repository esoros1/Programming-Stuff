 This program reads in valid, paranthesized infix notation from a data file
 called "data3-1.txt", and processes it into postfix notation, which is stored
 as output in "data.txt"
 
 To run the conversion, type "make" in the directory, and then run ./postfix
 
 To test the conversion functions, type "make test", and then run ./test
 
 To test the Stack class, type "make stacktest", and then run ./stacktest
