General notes on writing good clean code:

Write good and descriptive comments, such comments help you when you return to your code and would 
save time comprehending your code and will help you avoid bugs

Before each method you write a have a functionality short summary, PRE and POST conditions 
Make sure that each method you write is responsible only for one functionality

Write clean methods, for each, divid its body to blocks with a header comment on top of each

Example:

/** 
I am responsible of one thing which is, ..
PRE:
POST: 
*/
type func( type varX, type varY) 
{
		// comment 1 about block1
		code, block1

		// comment 2 about block2
		code, block2

		// comment 3 about block3
		code, block3

		return;
}
