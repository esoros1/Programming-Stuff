-Grading for compiling and running your code uses our CS department UNIX machines, 
 so make sure that your code compiles with a make and runs under such environment
-have a README file that has instructions on how to run and compile your program or any notes
-Don't commit binary files, input files, output files .. only what you have in the tree up
-have your head comment (name .. etc) on each file
