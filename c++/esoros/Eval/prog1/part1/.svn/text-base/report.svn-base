-README file is needed
-add an empty line at the end of all of your source files to get rid of the warnings
-good job!

General Notes:
-For automatically copying your code to the Eval folder I need your folder tree to look like this, 
and to be consistent with everybody, next time I will cut some points for that:
-- cs33001 ( or YOURUSERNAME)
   |-- Eval
   `-- prog1
	    |-- part1
		|   |-- Makefile
		|   |-- README
		|   |-- bigint.cpp
		|   |-- bigint.h
		|   `-- main.cpp
	    `-- part2
		    |-- Makefile
		    |-- README
		    |-- bigint.cpp
		    |-- bigint.h
		    `-- main.cpp
-use the UNIX command "tree" to for such tree view
-Grading for compiling and running your code uses our CS department UNIX machines, 
 so make sure that your code compiles with a make and runs under such environment
-have a README file that has instructions on how to run and compile your program or any notes
-Don't commit binary files and unnecessary files or folders that have nothing to do with 
 compiling and running your program under UNIX under one our CS department machine-automatic 10/10 for all in this part
-make sure you read "General Program Requirements" [http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/CS33001/progReq.html]
-have your head comment (name .. etc) on each file
-contact me at aalali@cs.kent.edu, office MSB 152, office hours MW 2-3 at MSB 160
