The main is in bigint_u, which tests the functioanlity of the class. 
The program creates a text file called "data.txt" where the program was run, which test the print function.
If the char[] passed has more elements than maxSize, than the bigint is truncated.
For example: If maxSize = 6, then a bigint("1234567") would print out "123456".
